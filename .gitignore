# The following patterns were previously active.
# They have been commented out because the system "make" will pick up build
# products in the source tree causing strange build failures.  The benefit
# of avoiding an accidental commit of a binary is quickly offset by the
# liability of chasing build failures caused by "invisible" files.  This
# has burned a few people already and even the source of bug reports.
