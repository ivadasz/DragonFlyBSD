.Sh NAME
.Nm aperf
.Nd driver measuring effective CPU frequency via APERF/MPERF MSRs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device aperf"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
aperf_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for measuring the effective CPU frequency, using the
APERF and MPERF MSRs.
The values are exposed through the
.Dv HW_SENSORS
.Xr sysctl 3
tree.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%sysctl hw.sensors
hw.sensors.aperf.raw0: 2593 (Eff-Freq CPU0 (MHz))
hw.sensors.aperf.raw1: 2593 (Eff-Freq CPU1 (MHz))
hw.sensors.aperf.raw2: 2591 (Eff-Freq CPU2 (MHz))
hw.sensors.aperf.raw3: 2586 (Eff-Freq CPU3 (MHz))
.Ed
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports all AMD and Intel CPUs which provide the APERF and MPERF MSRs:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Most AMD CPUs starting at Family 10h
.It
Most Intel CPUs starting from Core series and Atom respectively.
