.Sh NAME
.Nm radeonkms
.Nd Driver for AMD/ATI Radeon graphics chipsets
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the radeon graphics chips by AMD/ATI.
Currently supported chipsets include almost all GPU chipsets up to the
Sea Islands generation.
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxx"
.It Va drm.radeon.no_wb
Disables AGP writeback for scratch registers.
.It Va drm.radeon.dynclks
Enable/Disable dynamic clocks
.It Va drm.radeon.r4xx_atom

.It Va drm.radeon.msi
MSI interrupts are not supported yet for RADEONKMS.
Trying to enable MSI forcibly may prevent the driver from working
(since MSI support is currently unavailable in the vgapci driver).
XXX explain possible values 1, 0, -1
.It Va drm.radeon.lockup_timeout
XXX
.It Va drm.radeon.fastfb
Direct FB access for IGP chips, which can significantly improve performance
for some applications.
This option currently only affects the RS690, RS780 and RS880 chipsets.
(1 = enable, 0 = disable (default))
.It Va drm.radeon.dpm
DPM (dynamic power management) support.
(1 = enable, 0 = disable, -1 = auto (default))
.It Va drm.radeon.aspm
XXX
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
If display backlight level can be controlled by the GPU (which is mostly
the case in notebooks), the sysctl
.Va hw.backlight_level
can be used to adjust the backlight level.
Permitted values are from 0 to the value returned by the
.Va hw.backlight_max
sysctl.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr drm 4 ,
.Xr syscons 4
.Sh HISTORY
RADEONKMS was first available for Linux.
.Sh BUGS
Currently MSI interrupts cannot be used by
.Nm
because MSI support is still missing from the vgapci driver.
