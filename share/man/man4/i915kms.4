.Sh NAME
.Nm i915kms
.Nd Driver for Intel i915 family integrated graphics chipsets
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the integrated graphics chips by Intel.
.Sh HARDWARE
It supports all chipset generations from I915 up to the
integrated GPU of the Broadwell CPU family.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
If display backlight level can be controlled by the GPU (which is mostly
the case in notebooks), the sysctl
.Va hw.backlight_level
can be used to adjust the backlight level.
Permitted values are from 0 to the value of
.Va hw.backlight_max .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr drm 4 ,
.Xr syscons 4
.Sh HISTORY
I915KMS was first available for Linux.
.Sh BUGS
Currently MSI interrupts cannot be used by
.Nm
because MSI support
is still missing from the vgapci driver.
