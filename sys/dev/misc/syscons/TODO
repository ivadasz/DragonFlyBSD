- look at smstart() in sysmouse.c. Is the crit_enter() around the tty_token
  actually necessary?
- move xsize and ysize to the sc_softc_t struct
- adjust vidcontrol to scvidctl changes, or write a very simple tool to access
  the remaining syscons ioctls. (CONS_CURSORTYPE, CONS_BELLTYPE, CONS_GETINFO,
  etc.)
- if SC_CHAR_CURSOR and SC_BLINK_CURSOR are set, we are supposed to draw a
  blinking block/char cursor. Will need a blink call in the txtdev interface.
