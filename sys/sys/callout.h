/*
 * WARNING! The caller is responsible for stabilizing the callout state,
 *	    our suggestion is to either manage the callout on the same cpu
 *	    or to use the callout_init_lk() feature and hold the lock while
 *	    making callout_*() calls.  The lock will be held automatically
 *	    by the callout wheel for any call-back and the callout wheel
 *	    will handle any callout_stop() deadlocks properly.
 *
 * active  -	Returns activation status.  This bit is set by callout_reset*()
 *		and will only be cleared by an explicit callout_deactivate()
 *		or callout_stop().  A function dispatch does not clear this
 *		bit.  In addition, a callout_reset() to another cpu is
 *		asynchronous and may not immediately re-set this bit.
 *
 * deactivate -	Disarm the callout, preventing it from being executed if it
 *		is queued or the queueing operation is in-flight.  Has no
 *		effect if the callout has already been dispatched.  Does not
 *		dequeue the callout.  Does not affect the status returned
 *		by callout_stop().
 *
 *		Not serialized, caller must be careful when racing a new
 *		callout_reset() that might be issued by the callback, which
 *		will re-arm the callout.
 *
 *		callout_reset() must be called to reactivate the callout.
 *
 * pending -	Only useful for same-cpu callouts, indicates that the callout
 *		is pending on the callwheel or that a callout_reset() ipi
 *		is (probably) in-flight.  Can also false-positive on
 *		callout_stop() IPIs.
